# Restroom Occupancy
One way to effectively monitor the status of the restrooms is to install people counters that track the number of individuals who go in and out of the bathrooms throughout the day. After a certain number of people have passed through a restroom, a member of your team can head in to freshen it up, restocking supplies, cleaning fixtures and making repairs.

This project uses a Irisys counter to get the people that in or out in the last 30 minutes and show the results in a webpage.
